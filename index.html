    <h1> My Gold Rush </h1>

    <p>You’re golden and unreachable,
      everyone wants you — I can’t blame them.
      A gold rush, the kind that steals the air,
      yet I’m left wishing I could hold it.</p>

    <p>I like how open you are,  
    how you cling without apology,  
    how sweetness lives in your smallest gestures.  
    I like how you never give up,  
    how your mind is always building forward.  
    You carry qualities I’ve always wished for in myself.</p>

    <p>But what pulls me most  
    isn’t only your glow—  
    it’s the shadows you don’t hide.  
    The flaws that match mine,  
    the dark corners we both carry.  
    Even in the dark,
    you’re still a masterpiece I can’t unsee.</p>

    <p>I think of you the way I think of stars—
    distant, unreachable, yet always in my sky.
    Even with oceans keeping us apart,
    your light still reaches me,
    soft but unstoppable, like fate itself.
    And in that glow, I see all of you—
    the light, the shadows, the scars—
    and I love it all, because even in darkness,  
    you’re still a masterpiece I can’t unsee.</p>

    <p>Thank you for crossing paths with me.
    Even if our time was brief, you’ve been living rent-free in my mind.
    I still remember your comfort, your laugh, the way your mind works—so beautifully.
    It’s crazy how a stranger can leave a mark this deep.
    And somehow, even in a spark, you make me hope for what’s to come.
    </p>

  <p>
    ps. please don't feel bad for ghosting me. you probably don't even know me but that's fine. 
    i only followed you here on IG to wait for the chance to greet you a happy birthday. 
    i assumed it’s today, but I’m not even sure.
    this will be the last time I reach out.
    you’re a gold rush, you know? in the Taylor Swift–coded sense.
    and I’ve realized I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush.
    maybe someday, if you come to the Philippines, you’ll find the right one—naturally, without even searching.
    I hope you find the love you truly deserve.
    and I hope that, in time, I can grow into the same courage and beauty I see in you.
  </p>
