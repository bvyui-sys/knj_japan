    <h1> My Gold Rush </h1>

    <p>You’re golden and unreachable,
      everyone wants you — I can’t blame them.
      A gold rush, the kind that steals the air,
      yet I’m left wishing I could hold it.</p>

    <p>I like how open you are,  
    how you cling without apology,  
    how sweetness lives in your smallest gestures.  
    I like how you never give up,  
    how your mind is always building forward.  
    You carry qualities I’ve always wished for in myself.</p>

    <p>But what pulls me most  
    isn’t only your glow—  
    it’s the shadows you don’t hide.  
    The flaws that match mine,  
    the dark corners we both carry.  
    I think of you the way I think of stars—
    distant, unreachable, yet always in my sky.
    Even with oceans keeping us apart,
    your presence still reaches me.
    And in that glow, I see all of you—
    the light, the shadows, the scars—
    and I love it all, because even in darkness,  
    you’re still a masterpiece I can’t unsee.</p>

    <p>Thank you for crossing paths with me.
    Even if our time was brief, you’ve been living rent-free in my mind.
    I still remember your comfort, your laugh, the way your mind works—so beautifully.
    It’s crazy how a stranger can leave a mark this deep.
    And somehow, even in a spark, you make me hope for what’s to come.
    </p>

    <p>
    ps. please don't feel bad for ghosting me. you probably don't even know me but that's fine. 
    i only followed you here on IG to wait for the chance to greet you a happy birthday. 
    i assumed it’s today, but I’m not even sure.
    this will be the last time I reach out.
    you’re a gold rush, you know? in the Taylor Swift–coded sense.
    and I’ve realized I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush.
    maybe someday, if you come to the Philippines, you’ll find the right one—naturally, without even searching.
    I hope you find the love you truly deserve.
    and I hope that, in time, I can grow into the same courage and beauty I see in you.
    </p>
